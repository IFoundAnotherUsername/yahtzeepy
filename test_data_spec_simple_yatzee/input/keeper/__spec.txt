Every row represents a complete game state.
Since only one re-roll is allowed, only one keep decision is taken per turn.
Therefore there are always exactly 8 rows in a file. Line nr 1 is turn 1 etc.

Every row contains a python list with the following structure

Index		Description			Value
0		Ones field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
1		Twos field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
2		Threes field available		0=NO, 1=YES  	
3		Fours field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
4		Fives field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
5		Sixes field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
6		1-Pair field available		0=NO, 1=YES  
7		3-kind field available		0=NO, 1=YES  	
8		Number of dice with val 1	0-3
9		Number of dice with val 2	0-3
10		Number of dice with val 3	0-3 
11		Number of dice with val 4	0-3
12		Number of dice with val 5	0-3
13		Number of dice with val 6   	0-3

In the example file the available fields are chosen from ones to 3-of-a-kind.
Only ones are rolled every turn, represented by the value 3 at index8 for each row.
