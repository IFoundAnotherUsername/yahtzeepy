Every row represents a keep decision. 
Since only one keep is allowed per turn there are always exactly 8 rows in a file. 
Line nr 1 is turn 1 etc.

Every row contains a python list with the following structure

Index		Description				Value
0		Number of dice to keep with val 1	0-3
1		Number of dice to keep with val 2	0-3
2		Number of dice to keep with val 3	0-3 
3		Number of dice to keep with val 4	0-3
4		Number of dice to keep with val 5	0-3
5		Number of dice to keep with val 6   	0-3

NB: The sum of all decisions on each row cannot be greater than the number of total dice, ie. 3

In the example file all dice with value 1 are kept each turn, giving the value 3 at index0.
