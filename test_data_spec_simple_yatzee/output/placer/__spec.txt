Every row represents a place decision. 
Since only one placement is allowed per turn there are always exactly 8 rows in a file. Line nr 1 is turn 1 etc.

Every row contains a python list with the following structure

Index		Description					Value
0		Place dice total in ’Ones’ or strike		0=NO, 1=YES 
1		Place dice total in ’Twos’ or strike		0=NO, 1=YES 
2		Place dice total in ’Threes’ or strike	0=NO, 1=YES 
3		Place dice total in ’Fours’ or strike		0=NO, 1=YES 
4		Place dice total in ’Fives’ or strike  	0=NO, 1=YES
5		Place dice total in ’Sixes’ or strike		0=NO, 1=YES 
6		Place dice total in ’1-pair’ or strike	0=NO, 1=YES 
7		Place dice total in ’3-kind’ or strike	0=NO, 1=YES 

In the example file the place decisions are made from ’Ones’ to ’3-kind’.

NB: This data structure can probably be simplified.
